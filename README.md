## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom tailwind properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Was good doing the project with react and making it more modular than previous projects so far.
- Just gradually learning more tailwind tricks

### Continued development

This would be great as part of a larger project where it would be a recipe component that draws the data from a database
